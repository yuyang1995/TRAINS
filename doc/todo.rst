.. todo:: 
  Accelerate sampling method in simultaneous search of multiple sources 
  by only updating timing residuals caused by i-th source when only parameters of the i-th source is updated.

  **Finished on May 24, 2021**.

.. todo::
  Determine the number of sources in the signal model by comparing evidences of different models.
  Create a framework to trans the posterior of the model with less sources to the prior of the model with more sources.

.. todo::
  Create a more flexible interference to allow different numbers of data points in timing residuals of different pulsars.
